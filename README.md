## Y tho?

This is a starterkit for using [Streamer.bot(https://streamer.bot)]'s Websocket API to build
your very own GODOTVERLAY!

It includes the base scene and class, StreamerbotSockets, which contains the logic to get
you started building your very own Godotverlay.

Plug in your own Streamer.bot WebSocket URL and test it out.

All Streamer.bot events are included in the Globals.gd file so when you plug in, you
get EVERYTHING!  SO MUCH KNOWLEDGE!
